		We study the optimal disclosure policy of a firm that wishes to maximize its expected stock price in the classic setting in which its stock is traded by risk-averse investors and noise traders. We find that the optimal disclosure policy is imprecise and leads to skewed posterior beliefs. This policy subjects short positions to tail risk, causing investors to demand a large increase in price to absorb noise-trader purchases and leading to overvaluation. Despite providing purely firm-specific information, this policy impacts the firm's expected returns. We further show the firm can inflate its price even when restricted to simple policies that withhold news lying above or below a threshold.

		We develop a measure of how information events impact investors' perceptions of risk that is broadly applicable and simple to implement. We derive this measure from an option-pricing model where investors anticipate an announcement that simultaneously conveys information on the announcer's expected future cash flows and risk profile. We empirically implement the measure using firms' earnings announcements, and show that it closely aligns with our model's predictions and offers strong forecasting power for firms' risk-factor exposures, implied costs of capital, liquidity, and future investments. We also apply our measure toward studying disclosure regulation, the efficacy of text-based proxies, and market-wide events, providing novel evidence on the transmission, measurement, and implications of risk information.

		This paper studies how the public release of information regarding a firm's riskiness affects investors' incentives to acquire information about the firm and the firm's ability to acquire decision-useful information from its share price. I find that risk information complements investor learning by informing investors of when it is most lucrative to investigate the firm, thereby reducing liquidity. Furthermore, risk information causes the firm's stock price to contain more information when the firm's investment decisions have the greatest impact on its value, thereby improving investment efficiency. My analysis suggests that the information contained in firms' financial disclosures regarding their expected values and their risks significantly differ in their effects on the capital market.

	<b>Kevin Smith. An Option-Based Approach to Measuring Disclosure Asymmetry.</b>

	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	In this paper, I develop a measure of the difference in the amount of information that investors expect a forthcoming disclosure to contain should it reveal good news versus bad news (the disclosure's "asymmetry"). I derive this measure from a model of option prices leading up to an asymmetric disclosure. The model shows that the disclosure's asymmetry can be captured using a weighted change in option-implied return skewness leading up to its release. This measure's ability to capture investors' prior beliefs regarding asymmetry is advantageous when studying ex-ante decisions including contracting and information acquisition choices. I implement the measure on a sample of large firms' quarterly earnings announcements, finding evidence that investors anticipate cross-sectional, but not time-series variation in earnings' asymmetry.

		We consider a cheap talk setting with two senders and a continuum of receivers with heterogenous preferences. Receivers listen to just one sender, but can choose which sender to listen to. We determine that: (i) full communication is possible for a large set of sender preferences; (ii) both senders attract listeners only if they are oppositional and not too polarized; and (iii) senders with preferences that are closer to the average receiver preference are listened to by a greater proportion of receivers. In extensions, we endogenize the senders’ preferences and investigate the effects of an entertainment benefit derived by receivers.

<ul>In this paper, I develop a model in which risk-averse investors possess private information regarding both a stock's expected payoff and its risk. These investors trade in the stock and a derivative whose payoff is driven by the stock's risk. In equilibrium, the derivative is used to speculate on the stock's risk and to hedge against adverse fluctuations in the stock's risk. I analyze the derivative price and variance risk premium that arise in this equilibrium and their predictive power for stock returns. Finally, I examine the relationship between prices and trading volume in the stock and derivative.

		In this paper, we consider the price effects of risk disclosure. We develop a model in which investors are uncertain about the variance of a firm’s cash flows and the firm releases an imperfect signal regarding this variance. In our model, uncertainty over the riskiness of a firm’s cash flows leads to a variance uncertainty premium in its price. We demonstrate that risk disclosure decreases the firm’s cost of capital by reducing this premium and that the market response to risk disclosure is small when the expected level of risk is high. Moreover, we find that firms acquire and disclose more risk information when their cash flow risk is greater than expected. Finally, we demonstrate that in a multi-asset setting, only risk disclosure concerning systematic risks will impact the cost of capital.

		While researchers and practitioners alike estimate firms' exposures to systematic risk factors, the disclosure literature typically assumes that exposures are common knowledge. We develop a model where the firm's exposure to a factor is unknown, and analyze the effects of factor-exposure uncertainty on share price and the effects of disclosure about the exposure. We find that: (1) factor-exposure uncertainty introduces skewness and excess kurtosis in the cash flow distribution relative to the commonly used normal distribution; (2) risk-factor disclosure affects all moments of that distribution; and (3) the pricing of higher moments affects the price response of disclosure and the incentives to disclose. For example, factor-exposure uncertainty may actually increase price when the uncertainty implies positive skewness in the cash flow distribution. Hence, a reduction in uncertainty through disclosure may increase cost of capital. We also extend our model to multiple firms and show that factor-exposure uncertainty manifests as uncertainty about a firm's CAPM beta.

<h4 id=‘teaching’><b>Teaching</b></h4>
<b>ACCT611: Disclosure and Financial Markets</b>
The goal of this course is to provide graduate students with a working knowledge of the analytical literature that studies firms’ disclosure decisions and their impact on capital markets. The course also aims to teach students how to read and follow the basic derivations in this literature. We will focus on a subset of the disclosure literature that analyzes disclosure’s impact on prices and trade, disclosure’s relationship with investor welfare, discretionary disclosure, costly signal manipulation, and the real effects of disclosure. Throughout the course, we will first lay out the mathematical tools and core economic frameworks that appear throughout the models of disclosure. We will then examine how these frameworks can add depth to our understanding of disclosure decisions and their consequences.
