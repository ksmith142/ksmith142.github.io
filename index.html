<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3519543">[paper]</a>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		We develop a measure of how information events impact investors’ perceptions of firms’ riskiness. We derive this measure from an option-pricing model where investors anticipate an announcement containing information on the mean and variance of firms’ future prices. We apply the measure to firms’ earnings announcements and show it has many desirable properties: it predicts firms’ return volatilities, risk-factor exposures, implied costs of capital, the timing of heightened volatility, and deterioration in fundamental performance, and outperforms textual-based proxies. Together, our study offers an approach for studying risk information conveyed by information events that is simple to implement and broadly applicable.

<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3282057">[paper]</a>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		In this paper, I study the impact of a firm's risk disclosure on investors' desire to acquire information about the firm. I first show that risk disclosure complements private learning by enabling sophisticated investors to acquire information when it is most lucrative to do so, thereby reducing liquidity. Next, in a setting in which investors possess information regarding the profitability of the firm's potential investments, I show that risk disclosure affects the firm's investment efficiency by influencing the usefulness of the information that the firm derives from its share price. Finally, I demonstrate that risk disclosure can reduce the firm's expected level of investment and therefore its expected risk.

</ul>
	<ul>
		We consider a cheap talk setting with two senders and a continuum of receivers with heterogenous preferences. Receivers listen to just one sender, but can choose which sender to listen to. We determine that: (i) full communication is possible for a large set of sender preferences; (ii) both senders attract listeners only if they are oppositional and not too polarized; and (iii) senders with preferences that are closer to the average receiver preference are listened to by a greater proportion of receivers. In extensions, we endogenize the senders’ preferences and investigate the effects of an entertainment benefit derived by receivers.

	In this paper, I develop an option-pricing model that formally incorporates a disclosure event. Using the model, I first theoretically examine how two properties of the disclosure -- its overall informativeness and its informativeness given good relative to bad news -- influence the impact that it has on option prices around its release. I then show that, by jointly examining the prices of options with different strikes, a researcher can measure the properties of a single disclosure event, an impossible task using equity prices alone. Finally, I develop and analyze methods of performing this measurement task.

<ul>In this paper, I develop a model in which risk-averse investors possess private information regarding both a stock's expected payoff and its risk. These investors trade in the stock and a derivative whose payoff is driven by the stock's risk. In equilibrium, the derivative is used to speculate on the stock's risk and to hedge against adverse fluctuations in the stock's risk. I analyze the derivative price and variance risk premium that arise in this equilibrium and their predictive power for stock returns. Finally, I examine the relationship between prices and trading volume in the stock and derivative.

		In this paper, we consider the price effects of risk disclosure. We develop a model in which investors are uncertain about the variance of a firm’s cash flows and the firm releases an imperfect signal regarding this variance. In our model, uncertainty over the riskiness of a firm’s cash flows leads to a variance uncertainty premium in its price. We demonstrate that risk disclosure decreases the firm’s cost of capital by reducing this premium and that the market response to risk disclosure is small when the expected level of risk is high. Moreover, we find that firms acquire and disclose more risk information when their cash flow risk is greater than expected. Finally, we demonstrate that in a multi-asset setting, only risk disclosure concerning systematic risks will impact the cost of capital.

</ul>
	<ul>
		While researchers and practitioners alike estimate firms' exposures to systematic risk factors, the disclosure literature typically assumes that exposures are common knowledge. We develop a model where the firm's exposure to a factor is unknown, and analyze the effects of factor-exposure uncertainty on share price and the effects of disclosure about the exposure. We find that: (1) factor-exposure uncertainty introduces skewness and excess kurtosis in the cash flow distribution relative to the commonly used normal distribution; (2) risk-factor disclosure affects all moments of that distribution; and (3) the pricing of higher moments affects the price response of disclosure and the incentives to disclose. For example, factor-exposure uncertainty may actually increase price when the uncertainty implies positive skewness in the cash flow distribution. Hence, a reduction in uncertainty through disclosure may increase cost of capital. We also extend our model to multiple firms and show that factor-exposure uncertainty manifests as uncertainty about a firm's CAPM beta.

<h4 id=‘teaching’><b>Teaching</b></h4>
<b>ACCT611: Disclosure and Financial Markets</b>
The goal of this course is to provide graduate students with a working knowledge of the analytical literature that studies firms’ disclosure decisions and their impact on capital markets. The course also aims to teach students how to read and follow the basic derivations in this literature. We will focus on a subset of the disclosure literature that analyzes disclosure’s impact on prices and trade, disclosure’s relationship with investor welfare, discretionary disclosure, costly signal manipulation, and the real effects of disclosure. Throughout the course, we will first lay out the mathematical tools and core economic frameworks that appear throughout the models of disclosure. We will then examine how these frameworks can add depth to our understanding of disclosure decisions and their consequences.
